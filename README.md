# gitAutoPush
This project automates the pushing and commiting of git for those times where you are in a hurry and forget.
There are two main cases that this project aims to take care of.
The first is the event where you forget to make commits or push existing commits before shutting down your computer.
In this case the program will first push all pending commits. The next step is to deal with things that havn't been committed. It will first try to do some on it's own and then get user input by halting the shutdown process if needed.
